                            Back during midterms, I set a goal for myself—to stop procrastinating and try to submit my homework at least a day before it was due. Looking back, I’d say I managed to stick with it most of the time. I definitely noticed that I was managing my time a bit better and not cramming like I used to. But I’ll admit, there were still times when I cut it close and ended up turning things in on the deadline day, especially when I had a lot of stuff going on.                            
                        </p>
                        <p class="reflection-text">
                            What stood out to me from all this is that making a plan really helps, but things don’t always go the way you want. Sometimes other priorities come up, and I just had to adjust. I also realized I need to be better at breaking things into smaller chunks, so I don’t get overwhelmed. Moving forward, I want to try setting my own earlier deadlines and start working on things right after they’re assigned. That way, even when things pile up, I won’t fall behind.                          
                        </p>

                            In the end, I’m still glad I made that goal. I wasn’t perfect, but I’ve improved—and that’s something I can feel good about.                          
                        </p>

                            By studying Understanding the Self, I have had a rich experience of reflection, insight, and growth. I learned that getting to know myself is more than surface traits, it is knowing my thoughts, values, feelings, relationships, and the many influences that shape me into who I am. This course taught me more about how I perceive myself, how others perceive me, and how I interact with the world around me.

                            One of my most important realizations is that self-awareness is a continuous process.  It's acceptable to change, question, and not always have answers.  What matters most is that I stay honest with myself and am willing to grow.
                        </p>

                            To my future self, I pledge to remain humble, to prioritize growth over ease, and to treat myself more gently in all stages of life.  I hope you will look back and be grateful that I made an effort to understand and appreciate who we are.
